# CRYPTOGRAPH ![alt text](https://github.com/Peggy535/Cryptograph/blob/master/assets/images/Logo.svg") - Wayne Pegg Milestone 2 submission - Code Institute/Full Stack Web Developer

CRYPTOGraph/CRYPTOGraphy is my submission for one of my 5 assessment projects for the above mentioned course.

However, since starting this project and having researched into this area, there is also a possible and future business product that will be discussed breifly later in the file.

This site is currently published on the following link:

## Conception

Having a avid interest in Cryptocurrency, Options trading and Data Analytics, I was drawn to this option for my milestone 2 project.

Having used several different trading platforms, I understand that it can take some time for the user to comprehend and fully appreciate how the respective
dashboards function. I have also experienced frustration in what I term, 'negative investor friendly functionality'. As an investor, I have one sole objective ultimately, to make profit as easily as possible. I don't neccesarily want to have to use mathematics to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI)

Another important function which appears to be lacking in current software and trading platforms is a lack of effective and efficient notification. I have experienced, many times, late notifications or none at all when assets have hit or reached certain profit targets. As you can imagine, this is extremely frustrating!

The purpose of this project is straight-forward. Provide a user-friendly, simple and information-rich dashboard that portrays the information I wish to have as an investor of a Crypto Currency asset. In this case, Bitcoin (BTC). Ultimately, as an investor, I will have and set a specific ROI. For this example, I have assumed the following:

"I'm the holder of 1 BTC that I purchased on the 1st April 2018 for $4000. My profit target is 350% ROI. I want a dashboard has information that is bias towards my desires! That is, when my assets reach 350% ROI"

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
